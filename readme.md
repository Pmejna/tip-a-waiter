# 100 days coding challange

## Project one - minigame: *"Tip a waiter"*
This is a part of my coding challange - coding personal projects for 100 days in a row. 

## What next?
Need to refactor this code by creating a "Game" object - to make code better structured and to hide some variables as well. 
Additional function - timer, or possibilty to change the tip percentage.
